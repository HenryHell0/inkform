## THE PLAN!!!:
- ↩️ add undo/redo
- 🔗 add save/load with the link (shareable!!)
- 😜 refactor widgets to organize and follow best pracitces of like vue architecture organization... --- NOTE: tf does this mean


### General

- 8 editable expression component!
- 6 infinite pannable camera 
    - grab icon panning tool
    - home icon tool that bring you to original position
    - spacebar on laptop
- 4 make a robust way to represent expressions with promises so the user can graph/solve them before they load
- 2 add different settings for the tools that pop down in a different menu (stoke width, color, etc. ) - make it cute
- 1 switch HMER select button to having a little AI star

### Graphs:

- 6 make it so that hovering a graph with an expression blurs/makes it clear you can drop it in. noone will know you can do that.
- also consider (later) making it so that you can select a portion of the graph to set the bounds


### DONE:
- 🔨 refactor toolbar
- 🖌️ add global color scheme with :root so its nice and easy
